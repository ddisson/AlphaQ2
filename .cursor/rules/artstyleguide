## 1. Visual Theme & Mood

**Pixar-Inspired Look**: Vibrant colors, friendly, cartoonish characters, soft shading, gentle gradients.

**Overall Mood**: Whimsical, warm, and inviting. The goal is to spark curiosity and maintain a playful environment.

## 3. Typography

### Primary Font
A rounded, playful sans-serif (e.g., **Comic Neue**, **Fredoka One**, or similar):

- Large, easy-to-read letters
- Slightly thicker strokes to match the cartoon style

### Secondary Font
A light sans-serif (e.g., **Lato**, **Nunito**) for smaller text or sub-labels.

### Font Sizes

- **Titles/Headings**: ~36–48pt (big, bold)  
- **Body Text**: ~24–28pt (still large for children’s readability)  
- **Button Text**: ~24pt

## 4. Buttons & Interactive Elements

- **Shape**: Rounded rectangles or pill-shaped, soft corners

### Color States
- **Default**: Bright color fill (Sky Blue, Coral Red, etc.) with white text  
- **Hover/Pressed**: Slightly darker or lighter shade, subtle shadow  
- **Disabled**: Grayed-out or lighter tone  

**Icons on Buttons**: Large, flat illustrations with thick outlines.

**Call to Action**: Use a bright accent color (e.g., **Coral Red** or **Sunny Yellow**) to stand out.

## 5. Iconography & Illustrations

- **Letter Characters**: Subtle faces, big eyes, expressive gestures—like Pixar characters

### Supporting Characters

- **Particle Effects**: Sparkles, stardust, small confetti bursts on task completion or taps  
- **Easing**: Soft ease-in-out for a playful, friendly feel

## 8. Voice & Tone

- **In-App Text**: Simple language, warm, encouraging (e.g., “Great job!”, “Let’s try again!”)  
- **Voiceover**: Friendly, enthusiastic narrator voice

## 9. Additional Guidelines

- **Scaling**: All graphics should scale well for iPad resolution  
- **Consistency**: Reuse colors, shapes, and fonts across all screens  
- **Child-Friendly**: Large tap targets (minimum 9–10mm) for little fingers  
- **Sound Design**: Soft, pleasant confirmation sounds and success jingles; minimal negative feedback

---

## 10. Implementation Tips

- Keep file sizes optimized  
- Use vector-based assets where possible for sharp scaling  
- Test color contrasts to maintain clarity on iPad screens
