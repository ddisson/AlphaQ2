```

## Required Audio Files

### 1. UI Sound Effects (SFX folder)

## AudioService Integration Status

✅ **Completed:**
- AudioService updated to match file structure
- Letter sounds: `playLetterSound(letter:)` → `letter_a.m4a`
- Word sounds: `playWordSound(word:)` → `Apple.m4a`, etc.
- UI sounds: `playUISound(soundName:)` → `success.m4a`, etc.
- Celebration: `playCelebrationSound()` → `celebration.m4a`

✅ **Views Updated:**
- LetterIntroductionView: Plays letter sound on appear
- WordAssociationView: Plays word sound on tap
- Level1FillView: Plays success/failure sounds
- Level2TraceView: Plays success/failure sounds  
- Level3FreeDrawView: Plays celebration/failure sounds

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Add missing audio files** to SFX and Music folders (completed)
2. **Test audio playback** in simulator/device
3. ✅ **Add background music** integration to main views (completed)
4. **Create Letter B** audio files when expanding beyond MVP

## Phase 3.8 Status: Complete Navigation Flow

✅ **Completed:**
- MainMenuView with letter selection and progress tracking
- LetterFlowView managing complete letter flow
- CongratulationsView with confetti animation
- Level completion notifications
- Letter B data structure (placeholder paths)
- Background music integration in MainMenuView

⚠️ **Missing for Letter B:**
- Audio files in `Letters/Letter_B_sounds/` folder
- Image assets for Letter B words

## Notes

- All audio files use `.m4a` format for consistency
- AudioService loads music preference from UserSettings
- Success sounds are consistent across levels
- Level 3 uses celebration sound for final completion
